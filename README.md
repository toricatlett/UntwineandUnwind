Untwine and Unwind Read Me

Untwine and Unwind is a business we created from our love of creativity and relaxation. Our idea is to hand make 100% natural products, including bath bombs, soaps, and scrubs. With this project, we thought it would be a really cool opportunity to create our own business-even though we don’t actually sell the items- rather than do a website for an already existing one. We wanted the freedom to make our own design and layout decisions.

The website consists of 7 pages: Home, Bath Bombs, Soaps, Scrubs, Essential Oils, Our Philosophy, and Contact.

Home: In the beginning, we made a wire frame mapping out the basic structure of the website and some design aspects. We wanted to keep the site simple and sleek, so we decided on the color scheme pretty early on with easy to look at colors. This was the first page we created and wanted it to set the tone for the rest of the site- clean, simple, and pretty.

Bath Bombs: We wanted to keep the webpage uniform so it would stay simple and pleasing to the eye. So the layout of bath bombs, soaps, and scrubs are virtually the same with the exception of the information on them.This page shows bath bomb products and along with every other page, has a navigation bar, so the site is easy to explore. At first, we had trouble getting multiple pictures in a horizontal line. But once we figured out to make a div with row and column as containers and put the images in there, we just copied and pasted that on the bath bomb, scrub, and soap pages.

Soaps: At the top of every page, there’s a picture corresponding to what the page is about. At first, we didn’t know how to size them correctly to be proportional and stay at the top. We decided to set the width and height to 100% and give it a relative position. This makes these pictures big which we liked since it makes the page feel more full. The pictures of the actual bath bombs, soaps, and scrubs are ones we took. The rest we borrowed from online.

Scrubs: This has our scrubs on them with the same layout as bath bombs and soaps. With codepen, you can’t exceed 10 pages, so when you click on the product, it doesn’t go to another page specifically for that product. But in order to show more pictures of each bath bomb, soap, and scrub, we had the idea for the picture to change when you hover over it. So when your mouse isn’t on it you just see the product and then when your mouse is on it, you can see the packaging.

Essential Oils: This page is a bit different than the others with it’s layout. The essential oils aren’t a product like the bath bombs, soaps, and scrubs. We just wanted to give a short description of each essential oil along with the benefits it gives, so the customer has an idea of which to purchase based on their wants.

Our Philosophy: This has our message of using natural products and how we had the idea to make our own business.

Contact: This has our instagram handle.

The biggest struggle we had was to make the website look the same when you adjust the size. It is responsive, but it just doesn’t look the exact same in full page and when you shrink it down.We looked at different sites such as w3schools for help, but we’re currently struggling with making everything the same size no matter the size of the screen.
